<h1><span class="sp1"><i>Say "Hello" for Me</i></span></h1>

<h2>By FRANK W. COGGINS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This was</span> to be <i>the day</i>, but
of course Professor Pettibone
had no way of knowing it. He arose,
as he had been doing for the previous
twenty years, donned the tattered
remnants of his space suit,
and went out into the open. He
stood erect, bronzed, magnificent,
faced distant Earth, and recited:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Good morning, bright sunshine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're glad you are here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You make the world happy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring us good cheer."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>It was something he had heard
as a child and, isolated here on
Mars, he had remembered it and
used it to keep from losing his
power of speech.</p>

<p>The ritual finished, he walked
to the edge of the nearest canal,
and gathered a bushel or so of dried
Martian moss. He returned and began
polishing the shiny exterior of
the wrecked space ship. It had to
really glitter if it was to be an effective
beacon in guiding the rescue
ship.</p>

<p>Professor Pettibone knew&mdash;had
known for years&mdash;that a ship would
come. It was just a matter of time,
and as the years slipped by, his
faith diminished not a whit.</p>

<p>With his task half completed, he
glanced up at the sun and quickened
the polishing. It was a long
walk to the place the berry bushes
grew, and if he arrived too late, the
sun would have dried out the
night's crop of fragile berries and
he would wait until the morrow for
nourishment.</p>

<p>But on this day, he was fated to
arrive at the bush area not at all,
because an alien sound from above
again drew the Professor's eyes
from his work, and he knew that
<i>the day</i> had arrived.</p>

<p>The ship was three times as large
as any he had ever visualized, and
its futuristic design told him,
sharply, how far he had fallen behind
in his dreaming. He smiled and
said, quite calmly, "I daresay I am
about to be rescued."</p>

<p>And he experienced a thrill as the
great ship set down and two men
emerged therefrom. A thrill tinged
with a guilt-sense, because emotional
experiences were rare in an
isolated life and seemed somehow
indecent.</p>

<p>The two men held weapons.
They advanced upon Professor Pettibone,
looked up into his face, reflected
a certain wary hostility.
That the hostility was tinged with
instinctive respect, even awe, made
it no less potent.</p>

<p>One of them asked, "Fella&mdash;man
came in ship&mdash;sky boat&mdash;long
time ago. Him dead? Where?" Appropriate
gestures accompanied the
words.</p>

<p>Professor Pettibone smiled down
at the little men and bowed. "You
are of course referring to me. I
came in the ship. I am Professor
Pettibone. It was nice of you to
hunt me up."</p>

<p>The eyes of the two Terran
spacemen met and locked in startled
inquiry. One of them voiced
the reaction of both when he said,
"What the hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You no doubt are curious as to
the fate of the other members of
the expedition. They were killed,
all save Fletcher, who lasted a
week." Professor Pettibone waved
a hand. "There&mdash;in the graveyard."</p>

<p>But their eyes remained on the
only survivor of that ill-fated first
expedition. It was hard to accept
him as the man they sought, but,
faced with undeniable similarity
between what they expected and
what they had found, the two
spacemen had no alternative.</p>

<p>"I hope your food supply is ample&mdash;and
varied," Professor Pettibone
said.</p>

<p>This seemed to bring them out
of their bemusement. "Of course,
Professor. Would you care to come
aboard?"</p>

<p>The other made a try at congenial
levity. "You must be pretty
hungry after twenty years."</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;has it been that long? I
tried to keep track at first...."</p>

<p>"We can blast off anytime you
say. You're probably pretty anxious
to get back."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am. The changes, in
twenty years&mdash;must be breathtaking.
I wonder if they'll remember
me?"</p>

<p>A short time later, the Professor
said, "It's amazing. A ship of this
size handled by only two men."
Then he sat down to a repast laid
out by one of the awed spacemen.</p>

<p>But, after nibbling a bit of this,
a forkful of that, he found that
satisfaction lay in the anticipation
more so than in the eating.</p>

<p>"We'll look around and see what
we can find in the way of clothing
for you, Professor," one of the
spacemen said. Then the man's bemusement
returned. His eyes traveled
over the magnificent physique
before him. The perfect giant of a
man; the great, Apollo-like head
with the calm, clear eyes; the expression
of complete contentment
and serenity.</p>

<p>The space man said, "Professor&mdash;to
what do you attribute the
changes in your body. What is there
about this planet&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know." Professor
Pettibone looked down his torso
with an impersonal eye. "I think
the greenish skin pigmentation is
a result of mineral-heavy vapors
that occur during certain seasons.
The growth. As to my body&mdash;I really
don't know."</p>

<p>But the two spacemen, though
they didn't refer to it&mdash;were not
concerned with the body so much
as the aura of completeness, the
radiation of contentment which
came from somewhere within.</p>

<p>And it was passing strange that
nothing more was said about the
Professor returning to Earth. No
great revelation, suddenly arrived
at, that he would not go. Rather,
they discussed various things, that
three gentlemen, meeting casually,
would discuss.</p>

<p>Then Professor Pettibone arose
from his chair and said, "It was
kind of you to drop off and see
me."</p>

<p>And one of the spacemen replied,
"A pleasure, sir. A real pleasure
indeed."</p>

<p>Then the Professor left the ship
and watched it lift up on a tail of
red fire and go away. He raised
an arm and waved. "Say 'hello' for
me," he called. Then he turned
away and, from force of habit, he
began again to polish the hull,
knowing that he would keep it
shining, and be proud of it, for
many years to come.</p>

<hr />

<p>Almost beyond reach of the
planet, one of the spacemen flipped
a switch and put certain sensitive
communication mechanisms to
work. So sensitive, they could pick
up etheric vibrations far away and
make them audible.</p>

<p>But only faintly, came the pleasant
voice of a contented man:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Good morning, bright sunshine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're glad you are here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You make the world ..."<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="hd1">THE END</p>
